        <h2> 
            Motivation for construct this website 
        </h2>
        <p> The main reason for making this website is because 
            a single word document resume cannot contain and well-orgnized my entire experience of my life.
            We only live in this world once why do not create something that can be saved.
            What a tragedy if you cannot search your name on Google.
            Maybe I'm just an ordinary person and not known by the world, but I can use this website to be memorized by my future child and grandchild.
        </p>
        <h2>
            How did I construct this website
        </h2>
        <p>
            I did a lot of research about making a website. Most of them recommanded some websites which have lots of templates and you can simply construct it on their website, some of them are even free.
            However, I decided to construct this website fully by typing code using HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT, what a great chance to learn three new programming languages, and your website is a place to demostrate your work.
