    <h3> Introduction </h3>

    <p> The purpose of our project was to help Toronto Police Service visualize and analyze their Break and Enter (B&E) data to identify patterns and anomalies.
        Temporal trends and spatial trends would be useful to help the police better distribute their forces. <br>
        <br>
        The Break and Enter dataset we used is a subset of the Major Crime Indicators (MCI) 2014 to 2019 occurrences (by reported date).
        The dataset includes 43,302 observations and 24 variables which also includes information on when the B&E occurred, where B&E occurred, when the incident was reported, in what neighbourhood, police division, etc.
    </p>

    <h3> Objectives </h3>

    <p>
        The question we wanted to address is whether there is a correlation between Break and Enter occurrences and variance of time.
        We split this question into three areas of interest which we want to determine:
        <br>
        - Is there any difference between the proportion of daytime B&E occurrences and nighttime B&E occurrences? (One Sample Hypothesis Test)
        <br>
        - Do Break and Enters tend to happen more often aroung midnight (12 - 1am)? (Confidence Interval Using Bootstrap)
        <br>
        - Do weekdays and weekedns have the same proportion of B&E happening during night (12 am to 5 am) changes depending on time. (linear Regression)
        <br>
        Bonus Point: We also wanted to address if the proportion of B&E happening during night (12 am to 5 am) changes depending on time. (linear Regression)
